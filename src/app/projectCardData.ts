      "I recently completed a personal project a website featuring user authentication, a well-structured object model with item categorization, and Microsoft SQL (T-SQL) as the database management system. As part of the project, I successfully integrated Google authentication, allowing users to securely log in using their Google credentials. To ensure the functionality and reliability of the website, I performed thorough unit testing of functions using a mock database.",

The application provides real-time data updates, a responsive form experience, reusable code logic through custom hooks, and seamless navigation between different components within the SPA. This results in an interactive and efficient user experience.",

To create objects, a user-friendly form page is provided, allowing users to input data and save images in the local storage. This approach eliminates the need for an external database, providing convenience and flexibility for users to manage their data locally",
